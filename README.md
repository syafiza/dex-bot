## 🔥 Overview

**LPing** is a **modular, agentic AI trading system** designed to:
- **Discover, analyze, and trade newly launched Solana memecoins** on Raydium, Meteora, Orca, and Pump.fun.
- **Identify cross-DEX arbitrage opportunities** in real time using advanced AI models.
- **Autonomously execute trades**, manage liquidity, and optimize portfolio using a swarm of specialized AI agents.

Unlike rule-based bots, LPing uses **reinforcement learning**, **NLP**, **computer vision (for chart pattern recognition)**, and **unsupervised anomaly detection** to adapt to the chaotic, fast-moving memecoin ecosystem.

| **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | Optimize trade timing, position sizing, and exit strategies.            |
| **Deep Neural Networks**       | Predict short-term price movements from on-chain + off-chain signals.   |
| **NLP (Transformer Models)**   | Monitor Twitter, Telegram, DexScreener, Birdeye for sentiment & hype.   |
| **Computer Vision (CV)**       | Analyze candlestick charts for breakout/fakeout patterns (via CNNs).     |
| **Unsupervised Learning**      | Cluster new tokens by behavior; detect rug pulls or honeypots.          |
| **Supervised Learning**        | Classify token legitimacy using historical scam/rug data.                |
| **Multi-Agent System**         | Specialized agents: Scout, Arbitrageur, Trader, RiskManager, Executor. |
| **Big Data Pipeline**          | Ingest 10k+ events/sec from Solana RPC, DEX APIs, and social feeds.      |
| **Planning & Scheduling**      | Coordinate agent workflows using hierarchical task networks (HTNs).     |
